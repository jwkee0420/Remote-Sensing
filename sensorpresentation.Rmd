# Landsat-8

* Landsat-8 is a Earth Observation Satellite launched by NASA/USGS in 2013

* The satellite carries two instruments: 

  1. Operational Land Imager (OLI)
  
  2. Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 
  
* The OLI measures in the visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared wavelengths in 9 spectral bands (15-30m resolution) while TIRS measures and surface temperature in two thermal bands (100m resolution)

# Landsat-8 Products 

* There are multiple data products available for download for Landsat-8: 
  
  1. Level 1 products - radiometrically and geometrically corrected data to remove any distortion from the sensor, satellite and the Earth. Cloud masks are also provided in this product.
  
  2. Level 2 products - generated from Level 1 products through algorithms such as LaSRC to create products like surface reflectance and surface temperature.
  
  3. Analysis Ready Data (ARD) - pre-processed data for immediate use in scientific analysis such as time series and machine learning; these are obtained from Level 1 products. 
  
* Landsat-8 also comprises of Collection 1 and 2, with Collection 2 being more recent (2020) and having an improved accuracy and better atmospheric and radiometric calibration.

# Applications 

* There are wide range of application of the Landsat-8 data; some more common than others
  
  * For example, Surface Temperature, a Level 2 product, is specifically generated as a geophysical parameter which is useful in global energy balance studies and modelling. It is also useful in studying urban heat island, wildfires, and even phenological processes. 
  
  * Schroder et. al (2016) developed an active fire detection algorithm using Landsat-8 data which provided enhanced coverage and resolution for fire management over a global region.
  
  * Guha et. al (2018) on the other hand, examined the relationship between Land Surface Temperature with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and Normalised Difference Built-up Index through linear regression models. These indices are formed by transforming different bands found in Landsat-8 data.
